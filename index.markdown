In 2007 I finally made it. I got out of university, being 33, just successfully 
finished my doctorate in computer science. I confess - it was purely theoretical stuff
and I liked it. My [old homepage](http://thi.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de/~gramlich)
as a scientific assistant still exists.
If you are interested, take a look at [my publications](publications.html).
Actually the results have some practical
implications, mainly I tell people, what not to do, because they cannot expect efficient solutions.
Keep your hands off minimizing regular expressions.

So I got out and started programming at a little company. I thought, I knew a lot about programming.
Boy - was I wrong. I learned so much by doing. Unfortunately, there was nobody to teach me, but
there is a lot of good written stuff that I absorbed.

And then came the podcasts. I usually commute by bike and I used to listen to audio books.
But I discovered, that there are so many good free tech podcasts available.
Great - I could learn something without wasting any time.
If you are searching for programming related podcasts, take a look at 
[my subscribed feeds](http://www.spokenword.org/member/2709?style=0&src=f&ipp=50).

I find [Uncle Bob](http://www.objectmentor.com/omTeam/martin_r.html)
inspiring and got interested in [FitNesse]. In the last year I 
[became an active contributor](http://github.com/ggramlich/fitnesse).
I wrote a port of [Slim] to PHP in my spare time and use the result [PhpSlim] at work.
I am currently working on the Javascript port [JsSlim] in my spare time.

In the other part of my life, I am the head of the
[basketball department in our club](http://www.eosc.de/basketball),
active coach and referee.
